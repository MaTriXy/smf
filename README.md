**smf** is a new RPC system and code generation like gRPC, Cap n Proto,
Apache Thrift, etc, but designed for **microsecond tail latency***.

Current benchmarks in microseconds (e2e see docs)

| 60 byte payload  | latency   |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| p50              | 7us       |
| p90              | 8us       |
| p99              | 8us       |
